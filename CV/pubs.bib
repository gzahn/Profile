Algal tissues were surveyed for the presence and diversity of fungi by sequencing the ITS1 gene using Illumina technology. Fungi from these algae were then compared to previous fungal surveys conducted in Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems. Twenty-seven percent of the OTUs present on the mesophotic coral ecosystem samples were shared between the marine and terrestrial environment.

Studies of fungal biodiversity lag far behind those of macroorganisms, such as plants, and estimates of global fungal richness are still widely debated. Utilizing previously collected specimens to study patterns of fungal diversity could significantly increase our understanding of overall patterns of biodiversity from snapshots in time. Here, we investigated the fungi inhabiting the phylloplane among species of the endemic Hawaiian plant genus, Clermontia (Campanulaceae). Utilizing next generation DNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered approximately 1,780 fungal operational taxonomic units from just 20 DNA bank samples collected throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. Using these historical samples, we tested the macroecological pattern of decreasing community similarity with decreasing geographic proximity. We found a significant distance decay pattern among Clermontia associated fungal communities.

	abstract = {There has been very little effort to incorporate foliar microbiomes into plant conservation efforts even though foliar endophytes are critically important to the fitness and function of hosts. Many critically endangered plants that have been extirpated from the wild are dependent on regular fungicidal applications in greenhouses that cannot be maintained for remote out-planted populations, which quickly perish. These fungicides negatively impact potentially beneficial fungal symbionts, which may reduce plant defenses to pathogens once fungicide treatments are stopped. Using the host/parasite system of Phyllostegia kaalaensis and Neoerysiphe galeopsidis, we conducted experiments to test total foliar microbiome transplants from healthy wild relatives onto fungicide-dependent endangered plants in an attempt to mitigate disease and reduce dependency on fungicides. Plants were treated with total microbiome transplants or cultured subsets of this community and monitored for disease severity. High-throughput DNA screening of fungal ITS1 rDNA was used to track the leaf-associated fungal communities and evaluate the effectiveness of transplantation methods. Individuals receiving traditionally isolated fungal treatments showed no improvement, but those receiving applications of a simple leaf slurry containing an uncultured fungal community showed significant disease reduction, to which we partially attribute an increase in the mycoparasitic Pseudozyma aphidis. These results were replicated in two independent experimental rounds. Treated plants have since been moved to a native habitat and, as of this writing, remain disease-free. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple low-tech method for transferring beneficial microbes from healthy wild plants to greenhouse-raised plants with reduced symbiotic microbiota. This technique was effective at reducing disease, and in conferring increased survival to an out-planted population of critically endangered plants. It was not effective in a closely related plant. Plant conservation efforts should strive to include foliar microbes as part of comprehensive management plans.},

	abstract = {Aim

To test whether or not fungal communities associated with the widespread seagrass, Syringodium isoetifolium can be differentiated on either side of Wallace's line, a boundary line separating Asian and Australasian fauna. Additionally, we examine whether host multilocus genotype predicts fungal community composition.


Location

A total of 77 samples were collected from 14 sampling sites spanning the Indonesian archipelago.


Methods

We sequenced the fungal ITS1 gene using Illumia MiSeq technology and used a clustering-free Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm to infer ribosomal sequence variants. Data were analysed via non-metric multidimensional scaling, Mantel tests and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Binary and quantitative null models were used to determine whether results significantly deviated from random. Host genotype was determined by genotyping at 18 microsatellite loci and standard genetic analysis was performed in the R package APE.


Results

Significant differences in fungal community composition were detected on either side of Wallace's line (p = {\textless}.001 R2 = .040). A significant distance decay of similarity pattern was observed between ribosomal sequence variants and geographical distance (p = .001 R2 = .227) and several fungal ribosomal sequence variants were significantly associated with sampling sites found either east or west of Wallace's line.


Main conclusions

Fungi are generally considered to have excellent dispersal potentials and marine fungi have the potential to disperse far and wide in an environment that has no obvious barriers to dispersal. Despite this assumed excellent dispersal potential, we show that fungal communities on either side of Wallace's line are significantly different from one another. We speculate that limited dispersal and differences in habitat type are responsible for the observed pattern. Work examining biogeographical patterns in marine fungi is still in its infancy and further research is required to fully understand marine fungal biogeography.},

However, little is known regarding the spatial distribution of these communities or the processes and mechanisms that are responsible for creating these patterns. Here we show that bacterial communities associated with the reef-building coral, Pocillopora acuta, from nine offshore islands in an urbanised coral reef ecosystem (Singapore) can diverge sharply and are significantly different among sampling locations. We suggest that small-scale environmental factors such as prevailing surface currents and wind direction, even over short distances ({\textless} 1 km), are responsible for generating bacterial community structure. Considering the sharp differentiation we observe among bacterial communities from different sites, we recommend that future coral reef restoration projects consider the microbial aspect of the coral holobiont as this may affect the success of coral transplants in recipient populations.},

We inoculated the sterile plants with fully-factorial combinations of four fungal isolates, then measured flowering time and reproductive allocation for each treatment group under normal and water-stressed conditions. All plants inoculated with foliar fungi had significantly later flowering and greater seed mass than the sterile control groups. The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased.

We collected eight S. ilicifolium thalli from each of eight island locations and separated them into three structures—leaves, holdfast and vesicles. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and subsequent analyses revealed weak but significant differences in fungal community composition from different structures. Fungal communities were also significantly different among sampling localities, even over relatively small spatial scales (≤ 12 km). Unsurprisingly, all structures from all localities were dominated by unclassified fungi. Our findings demonstrate the potential of marine environments to act as reservoirs of undocumented biodiversity that harbour many novel fungal taxa. These unclassified fungi highlight the need to look beyond terrestrial ecosystems in well-studied regions of the world, and to fully characterize fungal biodiversity in hotspots such as Southeast Asia for better understanding the roles they play in promoting and maintaining life on our planet.},

Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 and subsequent analysis revealed significant differences in fungal communities collected from different locations and different structures.

While there is clear evidence that fungal-mediated processes can influence environmental conditions, and in turn select for specific fungi, it is less clear how fungi respond to environmental fluxes over relatively long time frames. Here we set out to examine changes in airborne fungi collected over the course of 13 y, which is the longest sampling time to date. Air filter samples were collected from the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) on Hawaii Island, and analyzed using Illumina amplicon sequencing. As a study site, MLO is unique because of its geographic isolation and high elevation, making it an ideal place to capture global trends in climate and aerobiota. We found that the fungal aerobiota sampled at MLO had high species turnover, but compositional similarity did not decrease as a function of time between samples. We attribute these patterns to neutral processes such as idiosyncratic dispersal timing and trajectories. Furthermore, the composition of fungi at any given point was not significantly influenced by any local or global environmental variables we examined. This, and our additional finding of a core set of persistent fungi during our entire sampling period, indicates some degree of stability among fungi in the face of natural environmental fluctuations and human-associated global change. We conclude that the movement of fungi through the atmosphere is a relatively stochastic process.},

However, the effects of host age on community structure and diversity of microbial associates remain equivocal in the few studies performed to date. To test this relationship more robustly, we use established techniques to accurately determine coral host age by quantifying annual skeletal banding patterns, and utilise high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively characterise the microbiome of the common reef-building coral, Porites lutea. Our results indicate no clear link between coral age and microbial diversity or richness. Different sites display distinct age-dependent diversity patterns, with more anthropogenically impacted reefs appearing to show a winnowing of microbial diversity with host age, possibly a consequence of corals adapting to degraded environments. Less impacted sites do not show a signature of winnowing, and we observe increases in microbial richness and diversity as the host ages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that corals of a similar age from the same reef can show very different microbial richness and diversity.},

Soil samples were taken from burn sites within one ecotype of temperate coniferous forest in Utah over a 20-year chronosequence. Sites were selected from available historic burns and were similar in plant community structure, elevation, slope, and aspect. Fungal DNA from these samples was compared to soil from paired unburned sites nearby to measure community similarity and estimate soil fungal recovery rates. Differences between paired burned and unburned sites remained fairly stable over a decadal time scale overall, but fungal community structure was found to recover more quickly in areas with a higher average annual temperatures. A significant positive correlation in community recovery was seen in areas with a difference of as little as two degrees celsius per year. The only other environmental variable that significantly interacted with time since burn was annual mean precipitation. As global temperatures increase, alpine fires are increasing as well, but these results suggest that fungal community recovery time will be shortened under new climate scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Many studies have examined these endophytes within a single plant species and/or at small spatial scales, but landscape-scale variables that determine their community composition are not well understood, either across geographic space, across climatic conditions, or in the context of host plant phylogeny. Here, we evaluate the contributions of these variables to endophyte beta diversity using a survey of foliar endophytic fungi in native Hawaiian dicots sampled across the Hawaiian archipelago. We used Illumina technology to sequence fungal ITS1 amplicons to characterize foliar endophyte communities across five islands and 80 host plant genera. We found that communities of foliar endophytic fungi showed strong geographic structuring between distances of 7 and 36 km. Endophyte community structure was most strongly associated with host plant phylogeny and evapotranspiration, and was also significantly associated with NDVI, elevation and solar radiation. Additionally, our bipartite network analysis revealed that the five islands we sampled each harboured significantly specialized endophyte communities. These results demonstrate how the interaction of factors at large and small spatial and phylogenetic scales shapes fungal symbiont communities.},

	abstract = {To study biogeography and other ecological patterns of microorganisms, including fungi, scientists have been using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as representations of species or species hypotheses. However, when defined by 97\% sequence similarity cutoff at an accepted barcode locus such as 16S in bacteria or ITS in fungi, these OTUs can obscure biogeographic patterns, mask taxonomic diversity, and hinder meta-analyses. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) have been proposed to alleviate all of these issues and have been shown to do so in bacteria. Analyzing ASVs is just emerging as a common practice among fungal studies, and it is unclear whether the benefits found in bacterial studies of using such an approach carryover to fungi. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of Hawaiian fungi by analyzing ITS1 amplicon sequencing data as ASVs and exploring ecological patterns. These surveys spanned three island groups and five ecosystems combined into the first comprehensive Hawaiian Mycobiome ASV Database. Our results show that ASVs can be used to combine fungal ITS surveys, increase reproducibility, and maintain the broad ecological patterns observed with OTUs, including diversity orderings. Additionally, the ASVs that comprise some of the most common OTUs in our database reveals some island specialists, indicating that traditional OTU clustering can obscure important biogeographic patterns. We recommend that future fungal studies, especially those aimed at assessing biogeography, analyze ASVs rather than OTUs. We conclude that similar to bacterial studies, ASVs improve reproducibility and data sharing for fungal studies.},

	abstract = {Beneficial microbes such as plant mutualistic fungi, hold the promise of ameliorating challenges faced in native plant conservation such as disease management. As an alternative to costly chemical pest control, conservation efforts could potentially harness the benefits of plant mutualistic fungi to aid in defense and disease resistance, but there are few tests of this notion. We set out to test the efficacy of controlling a common foliar pathogen, the powdery mildew Neoerysiphe galeopsidis, by inoculating the endangered Hawaiian plant species Phyllostegia kaalaensis with potentially beneficial members of its wild-type mycobiome. We tested whether inoculating plants with above or belowground fungal mutualists, or both, led to increased disease resistance in the host. We found that while all treatments reduced average disease incidence, colonization by the foliar yeast Moesziomyces aphidis was the only treatment to do so significantly. These results provide an exciting new strategy for plant conservation practices.},
